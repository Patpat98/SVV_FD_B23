# Flight Test Cessna Citation Flying Laboratory

This repository is part of the flight dynamics course within the Aerospace Bachelor Degree at TU Delft. A real life flight test in the Cessna Citation was carried out in which data was collected in scope of investigating the unstable and stable dynamic modes of the aircraft.

The test results were then documented validated using an existing data set in order to calculate the aircraft's aerodynamic parameters and investigate its response to its three primary control inputs.
