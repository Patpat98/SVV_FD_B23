# Flight test

This repository is in scope of the flight dynamics course within the Aerospace Bachelor Degree at TU Delft. A real life flight test in the Cessna Citation was carried out in which data was collected in order to investigate the unstable and stable dynamic motions of the aircraft.

The test results were then documented validated using an existing data set in order to calculate the aircraft's dynamic parameters and investigate its response to its three primary control inputs.
